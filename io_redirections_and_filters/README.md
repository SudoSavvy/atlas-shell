"I'll never let you down, boy, I'll never let you go"
Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
"So tell me that you're here, boy, " she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me without a place to go
Without a hint of light to watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first, against my will, but God invented chills

Yeah, I, I saw your ghost tonight
The moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine
My wounds would start to heal
