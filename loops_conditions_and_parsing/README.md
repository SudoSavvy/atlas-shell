Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail

He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to slayer
I'd like to find him friday night
Hanging out with mom, trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more
Girls are such a drag
